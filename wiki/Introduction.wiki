The reason for building a musical swarm robot is to explore new means of real time algorithmic music composition as well as novel forms of human robot interaction.  Swarm robots in general are meant to be designed as new ways to solve problems that a single more complex robot could not solve.  Using Android as the brain of each robot along with the ADK board for communication with robot hardware, and OpenCV for tracking of position and orientation, we create a versatile and cost effective swarm robot platform designed primarily around music.
